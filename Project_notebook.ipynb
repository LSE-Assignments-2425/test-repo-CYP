    "### 1.1 Research Background\n",
    "\n",
    "In recent years, urban areas worldwide have experienced rapid and high-quality development, especially in cities' physical infrastructure, public facilities, and residents' quality of life. According to predictions by the **United Nations**, 68% of the global population will be living in urban areas by 2050 ( *United Nations, 2018* ). However, as cities continue to grow and expand, the concentration of wealth and income growth among the highest earners will exacerbate economic inequalities, leading to more intense competition for limited urban resources ( *Sarkar et al., 2024* ). This indicates that urban development has to face the dilemma of inequality of public resources, including public facilities such as education, medical care, transportation, cultural & historical sites, and so on ( *Xu et al., 2022* ).\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, it is of great research importance to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Quantify the accessibility levels of multiple public facilities and analyze their spatial distribution patterns.\n",
    "- Assess the equity levels of various facilities based on different geographical locations and demographic groups.\n",
    "- Evaluate the impacts of various socio-economic factors on the accessibility levels of public facilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Such research can assist policymakers and urban planners in identifying spatial and demographic disparities in public resource access, understanding the underlying mechanisms and contributing indicators of these inequalities, and ultimately promoting **social justice** as well as the long-term **sustainable city development**."

    "### 1.2 Research Objectives and Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the research context, this project aims to conduct a comprehensive analysis of equitable access to two types of public facilities (education and health care) in New York City (NYC) on a [\"census tract\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Census_tract) scale. NYC is the largest city in the U.S. with substantial metropolitan economy and diverse demographic composition ( *Baghestani et al., 2024* ), which make it an ideal choice to be selected as the study area for our analysis. The study also seeks to provide meaningful insights into the spatial and statistical characteristics of accessibility scores and the (in)equality status for both facilities, and to investigate how different socio-economic factors contribute to their accessibility patterns in NYC. To achieve these objectives, the research will be organized into three parts, each answering specific research questions as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Facility accessibility-based spatial distribution analysis:**  \n",
    "- What is the spatial distribution of accessibility to different types of public facilities across all census tracts in NYC? \n",
    "- What are the overall geographical and numerical patterns of these accessibility levels/scores?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Equity assessment across different NYC boroughs and population groups:**  \n",
    "- Is the distribution of accessibility to different facilities equitable across all \"boroughs\" of NYC? In other words, is access to specific public facilities fairly distributed among all the \"five\" boroughs in NYC?\n",
    "- Is the accessibility equitable across different \"demographic groups\" (e.g., by race or income level)? Do demographic groups of different races and personal incomes have equal access to the same public facilities?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Importance assessment of relevant factors:**  \n",
    "- What is the contribution or importance level of various socio-economic factors (e.g., population density, income, transportation access, poverty levels, facility density) to the accessibility of different public facilities?\n",
    "- Does the importance ranking of these selected factors vary across different types of public facilities in influencing their accessibility levels?"

    "\n",
    "**The NYC boundaries data:**\n",
    "- ***NYC borough boundaries***: spatial vector polygons representing NYCâ€™s five boroughs (Manhattan, Bronx, Brooklyn, Queens, Staten Island). It is used for basic visualization for the study area, providing a general overview of the location, spatial extent & shapes, and geographical correlations of NYC's five boroughs.\n",
    "- ***NYC census tracts boundaries***: spatial vector polygons of NYC divided into smaller census tract scales. It serves as the **foundational dataset** for the study that supports calculations of census scale accessibility scores of education & health care facilities, equity assessments, and the final importance analysis factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NYC Open Street Map (OSM) roads and paths data:**\n",
    "- ***OpenStreetMap (OSM)*** provides open-source and latest online global geospatial data, including district boundaries, locations, transportation networks, water bodies, land use, etc. The extracted **NYC roads and paths** dataset includes line features representing transportation roads, residential streets, and pedestrian paths within NYC.\n",
    "- This dataset is used to compute **road density** (measured as the total length of roads per unit area) for each census tract, since road network density is one of the important factors influencing accessibility to public facilities ( *Liu et al., 2019* ; *Yin et al., 2018* ).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Facility POIs:**\n",
    "- The ***NYC Facilities Database*** contains geographical point data for various public facilities in NYC, including schools, hospitals, administration of government, parks/gardens, cultural & historical landmarks, and major transportation sites.\n",
    "- For this study, only **education** and **healthcare** facilities were extracted for accessibility assessment at the census tract level for NYC.\n",
    "\n",
    "**American Community Survey (ACS) socio-economic data:**\n",
    "- ACS is an ongoing nationwide community survey conducted by the [U.S. Census Bureau](https://www.census.gov/), containing socio-economic data of multiple topics at the census tract level every year, including housing, income, poverty, education, employment, health insurance coverage, and so on.\n",
    "- This project utilizes the [ACS 5-Year Data (2009â€“2023)](https://www.census.gov/data/developers/data-sets/acs-5year.html), which contains the most detailed data information on all socio-economic topics for all geographies within the U.S., including NYC. \n",
    "- We have selected **median income**, **poverty level**, and **population by race** indicators from ACS and use them for accessibility equity evaluation and factor importance analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Other indicators generated by the already accessed data:**\n",
    "- Additional census tract-level indicators are generated by integrating previously acquired datasets to enrich the final factor importance analysis, including:\n",
    "- (1) ***Road Density***: Generated by spatial-joining NYC census tracts data with OSM Roads and Paths lines.\n",
    "- (2) ***Population Density***: Calculated by combining NYC census tracts data with ACS Total Population indicator.\n",
    "- (3) ***Public Facility Density***: Generated by spatial-joining NYC census tracts with Facility POIs.\n",
    "- (4) ***Poverty Ratio***: Computed by linking NYC census tracts with ACS Poverty Level data.\n"

For instance, Brooklyn's distribution is relatively dispersed with a wider shape, indicating a larger variation in education accessibility among different census tracts in this borough. There exist areas with both relatively high and low accessibility.\n",
    "  - In contrast, Staten Island's distribution is relatively concentrated with a narrower shape, suggesting that the education accessibility in various census tracts within this borough is relatively close, with less variation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Mean Comparison:\n",
    "  - In terms of the mean, Brooklyn has the highest mean value of 0.195286, indicating that overall, this borough has relatively better education accessibility. On the other hand, Queens has a relatively lower mean value of 0.171001, which might imply that the overall performance of education resource accessibility in this borough is slightly inferior.\n",
    "  - The means of Manhattan and Bronx are 0.183482 and 0.183482 respectively, at a medium level. However, their distribution patterns differ. Manhattan's distribution is relatively more concentrated in the higher value range, while Bronx's distribution is more dispersed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**(3) Accessibility Distribution - Health Care**\n",
    "- Distribution Patterns:\n",
    "  - Queens has the most dispersed distribution of health care accessibility, with a long and narrow shape and a long \"tail\". This indicates that there is a significant variation in health care accessibility among different census tracts in this borough, possibly suggesting an uneven distribution of medical resources.\n",
    "  - Manhattan's distribution is relatively concentrated and has a more regular shape, indicating that the health care accessibility in various census tracts in this borough is relatively uniform with less variation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Mean Comparison:\n",
    "  - Queens has the highest mean value of 0.009974 for health care accessibility. However, due to its large degree of dispersion in the distribution, it implies that although the overall mean is high, there are some areas with relatively low accessibility that lower the overall balance.\n",
    "  - Brooklyn has a mean value of 0.008444, at a medium level, and its distribution pattern also shows a certain degree of dispersion.\n",
    "  - The means of Staten Island and Bronx are relatively low, at 0.009886 and 0.013391 respectively, and their distribution patterns also have their own characteristics. Staten Island is relatively concentrated, while Bronx is more dispersed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**(4) Comprehensive Comparison**\n",
    "- In terms of education accessibility, Brooklyn performs relatively well with a higher mean and a wider distribution, indicating good coverage of educational resources but also a certain degree of imbalance. Staten Island, on the other hand, is relatively balanced but has a slightly lower overall accessibility level.\n",
    "- In terms of health care accessibility, Queens has a high mean but a large degree of dispersion in the distribution, indicating an uneven distribution of resources. Manhattan is relatively balanced and shows a relatively stable overall performance."

    "The figure above shows the Lorenz Curve by Borough, with each colored curve corresponding to one borough. The horizontal axis represents the proportion of the cumulative distribution of the city's population from low to high, and the vertical axis represents the cumulative proportion of the accessibility under the corresponding population (such as the accessibility of education and medical facilities). The grey dashed **Equality Line** represents a completely equal distribution, and the more the curve deviates from the diagonal, the higher the inequality.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Gini Coefficient of different administrative regions has certain differences, as seen from the legend. The Gini Coefficient is usually between **0** and **1**:\n",
    "- **0** means perfect equality.\n",
    "- **1** means extreme inequality.\n",
    "\n",
    "**(1) Manhattan (Gini = 0.05)**  \n",
    "The curve is closest to the diagonal line, and the Gini Coefficient is about **0.05**, indicating that the accessibility is relatively balanced within the region.  \n",
    "- Most census tracts enjoy similar levels of accessibility, with very few extremely high or extremely low values.  \n",
    "- One possible explanation is that Manhattan's dense population, relatively uniform distribution of public facilities, and high accessibility by public transportation make the accessibility gap smaller.\n",
    "\n",
    "**(2) Bronx and Queens (Gini = 0.10)**  \n",
    "Both have a Gini Coefficient of **0.10**, implying higher internal inequality than in Manhattan.  \n",
    "- This may indicate that the two boroughs are more dispersed in terms of geographic scope or residential patterns.  \n",
    "- Some census areas may have better access to public facilities or transport, while others have relatively low accessibility, widening the gap.\n",
    "\n",
    "**(3) Staten Island (Gini = 0.08) and Brooklyn (Gini = 0.08)**  \n",
    "Compared to Queens and the Bronx, the Gini Coefficient is slightly smaller (**0.08**), but it is still significantly higher than Manhattan.  \n",
    "- This shows that there is still a certain degree of inequality in accessibility between the two, but it is not as prominent as in Queens and the Bronx.  \n",
    "- In areas such as Staten Island, the pattern of population density and facility distribution tends to result in some census areas having better access to transportation and facilities, while others are lagging behind, creating a moderate imbalance.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Policy and Planning Implications\n",
    "\n",
    "**(1) Resource Allocation Priority**  \n",
    "- Queens and the Bronx, which have the highest Gini Coefficient, may need more public facilities or transit improvements to reduce internal inequality.  \n",
    "- If these two districts have high poverty rates, additional resources should be allocated.\n",
    "\n",
    "**(2) The Relative Balance of Manhattan**  \n",
    "- Manhattan has the most balanced accessibility and the lowest Gini Coefficient, but it does not mean that all regions are equally good.  \n",
    "- A refined diagnosis needs to be combined with actual geography and population distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "**(3) Direction of Subsequent Analysis**  \n",
    "- This measure of inequality can be further cross-examined with factors such as demographics (age, race), housing prices, or employment location to see if there are specific disadvantaged groups concentrated in areas with low accessibility.  \n",
    "- By comparing the Gini Coefficient in time series or with other cities, the development trend and improvement degree of the region can also be assessed.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Conclusion\n",
    "- The Lorenz Curve and Gini Coefficient offer a powerful method to measure and visualize inequality. By combining these metrics with radar charts or cross-factor analyses, we can better understand resource distribution and provide actionable insights for urban planning and policy development.\n",
    "- n can also be assessed.\n",
    "- Region can also be assessed."

    "\n",
    "**(5) Cross-Group Analysis**\n",

    "  - The **Low-Income** and **Lower-Middle Income** groups exhibit similar and relatively balanced accessibility, likely due to targeted urban policies.\n",

    "     - Most census tracts have moderate accessibility (~0.20), but there are a few outliers with extremely low accessibility.  \n",
    "     - This aligns with the slight deviation observed in the Lorenz Curve.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **High-Income Group**:  \n",
    "     - The accessibility distribution for the high-income group is more concentrated, with higher overall values and fewer tracts with low accessibility.  \n",
    "     - This explains its slightly higher Gini Coefficient, indicating that the distribution is not entirely even.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Health Care Accessibility\n",
    "  - **Low-Income Group**:  \n",
    "     - The violin plot shows a broader distribution of health care accessibility for the low-income group.  \n",
    "     - The median value is lower compared to other groups, supporting the moderate inequality observed in the Lorenz Curve.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **High-Income Group**:  \n",
    "     - For the high-income group, accessibility is more concentrated with a higher median value.  \n",

    "\n",
    "**(2) Key Observations and Cross-Validation**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Validation of Lorenz Curve Findings\n",
    "    - The violin plots validate the findings of the Lorenz Curve: For example, the broader range of accessibility within the low-income group explains why its Lorenz Curve is closer to the Equality Line, indicating relatively balanced accessibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Middle-Income Groups\n",
    "    - The higher Gini Coefficients for middle-income groups (upper-middle and lower-middle) can be attributed to their accessibility distributions: These groups include both well-served and underserved census tracts, leading to a higher overall inequality.\n",
    "\n",
    "- High-Income Group\n",
    "    - The concentrated distributions in violin plots explain why the Gini Coefficient for the high-income group is higher but not excessively so: It reflects better overall accessibility with relatively equal resource allocation across census tracts.\n"

    "- **Education Facilities**\n",
    "  - Accessibility is driven by a balanced interplay of spatial and socio-economic factors.  \n",
    "  - **Road Density** plays a more prominent role in ensuring access, reflecting the importance of transportation infrastructure in reaching educational institutions.  \n",
    "  - **Facility Density** is a moderate contributor, suggesting that increasing the number of schools alone may not significantly boost accessibility without addressing spatial and socio-economic factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Health Care Facilities**\n",
    "  - Accessibility is heavily influenced by economic indicators such as **Median Income**, with infrastructure factors (road and facility density) playing a secondary role.  \n",

    "**Limitations and Future Improvements**  \n",
    "\n",
    "**(1) Data Limitations:**  \n",
    "- Regarding the Roads and Paths Data: Due to the huge data volume, OSM transportation lines dataset used may contain [topological errors](https://docs.qgis.org/3.34/en/docs/gentle_gis_introduction/topology.html#topology-errors), such as duplicate nodes and incorrect road intersections, which can cause unavoidable data inaccuracies. In this context, datasets that have undergone thorough topological checks should be prioritized in future studies.\n",
    "- Regarding the NYC Facility POIs: Many facility types (e.g., parks, gardens, historical sites, core infrastructure, and others) lack **\"capacity\"** attributes with values being zero or missing. This impedes the 2FSCA spatial accessibility calculation of these corresponding public facilities. Future studies could prioritize datasets with more complete attributes to improve analysis generalizability.\n",
    "\n",
    "**(2) Versatility of Equity Analysis Criteria**\n",
    " - This project mainly focused on **demographic** inequities based on **income level** and **racial** criteria. Research scope could be further expanded to consider additional delineation criteria, such as educational attainment, age, employment status, etc, which can provide a more comprehensive understanding of the equity status of public facility accessibility across more diverse demographics. \n",
    "\n",
    "**(3) Limited Incorporation of Indicators**  \n",
    " - The analysis of *Evaluation of Socio-economic Factorsâ€™ Impact on Facility Accessibility* could be further enriched by incorporating more representative indicators, such as urbanization rates ( *Yin et al., 2018* ), elevation ( *Liu et al., 2019* ), and so on. This approach would provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the factors influencing accessibility and enable more robust importance analyses to guide urban planning and policy-making.\n",
    "\n",
    "**(4) Model Limitations:**\n",
    "- This project employed a Gaussian decay function to calculate accessibility. However, to more realistically simulate travel conditions within cities, it would be possible to develop a segmented decay function by incorporating factors such as the average traffic congestion index ( *Luo & Qi, 2009* ; *Liao & Furuya, 2024*).\n",
    "- The XGBoost model used to compute SHAP values was not \"well-tuned\" through [**Hyperparameter optimization**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperparameter_optimization) due to extensive workload, which may impact the accuracy of the model training and fitting as well as the reliability of the SHAP value-based analyses. Future work could be improved by involving hyperparameter optimization or comparing multiple models to ensure more robust and unbiased insights. \n",
